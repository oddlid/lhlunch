Package that scrapes websites for what's for lunch the current day at Lindholmen, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden.

Mainly a playground for the author to learn Mojolicious, and keeping tabs on what's for lunch at the same time...

Currently running behind an nginx reverse proxy on my home server, serving at least 2 requests per day ;)
